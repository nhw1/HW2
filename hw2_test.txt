r: the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
r: branagh , in his most forceful non-shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit . 
r: disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids' books to the screen . . . tuck everlasting is a little of both . 
r: as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
r: 'estupendamente actuada , sumamente emotiva y profundamente humana , es una experiencia flmica imposible de olvidar'
r: wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too . 
r: for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
r: certainly no biopic , nijinsky is short on facts , but long on expression . 
r:  . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
r: plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
r: the film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both steve buscemi and rosario dawson . . . 
r: this is the first full scale wwii flick from hong kong's john woo . he's not good with people . 
r: the pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze . 
r: despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining . 
r: the script , like the character danny , is complex and needs your attention . . . 
r: when so many hollywood films actively discourage higher brain functions , you have to give changing lanes credit for giving you food for thought . 
r: a smart , provocative drama that does the nearly impossible : it gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic . 
r: an engrossing iranian film about two itinerant teachers and some lost and desolate people they encounter in a place where war has savaged the lives and liberties of the poor and the dispossessed . 
r: opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
r: ' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
r: while the subject's appeal is limited and the film's 106-minute running time excessive , viewers who do respond to the pic will find it raw , real and cathartic . 
r: admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form . 
r: there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . 
r: it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
r: it doesn't seem like it's following a fixed path to the finish . unlike so many movies , it feels alive . 
r: while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
r: hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry . 
r: a thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses grant's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos . 
r: director barry sonnenfeld and company retain much of the rubbery alien slapstick humor . 
r: the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . 
r: steeped in lore and unabashedly surreal , the film is just charming enough for children and just bizarre enough for adults -- a perfect balance . 
r: does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background . 
r: i have two words to say about reign of fire . great dragons ! 
r: 'the war of the roses , ' trailer-trash style . entertaining but like shooting fish in a barrel . 
r:  . . . flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . 
r: that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults . 
r: a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness . 
r: pascale bailly's rom-com provides amlie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . , a banal spiritual quest . 
r: the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there . 
r: the wild thornberrys movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate . 
r: an interesting psychological thriller that , more often than not , actually works . 
r: in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
r: charged with as much psychological depth as gun-slinging violence , johnny to and wai ka fai's slick thriller brought a welcome jolt of adrenaline to the moribund hong kong action genre . 
r: how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [franois and michle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 
r: there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected ( and gentle ) way . 
r: with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable . with freeman and judd , i'll at least remember their characters . 
r: when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
r: upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute . 
r: there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending . 
r:  . . . quite good at providing some good old fashioned spooks . 
r: a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
r: the movie is engaging and well acted , though , and the pink panther-style credits and background music are worth the price of admission . 
r: imagine a scenario where bergman approaches swedish fatalism using gary larson's far side humor
r: polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own world war ii experience in his signature style . 
r: britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
r: its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing . 
r: american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone . 
r: this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce . 
r: will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings . 
r: drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band . 
r: brilliantly captures the brightness of the light , the intensity of the colors and the omnipresence of mexican motifs that informed kahlo's art . 
r: gives an intriguing twist to the french coming-of-age genre . 
r: at the right time of day , in the right frame of mind , baran can and should be appreciated as a work of delicate and unmistakable beauty . 
r: all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as 'belgium's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline . 
r: sure , there are flaws , but the moments that do things properly see the screen burst with confidence , rhythm , heat and pizzazz . 
r: as animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth . 
r: it's gripping entertainment in a popular vein -- the police procedural -- that nevertheless follows no preconceived formulas . 
r: the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
r: to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
r: talk to her is excellent movie-making and much of it is wondrous , but my conscience won't allow me to be devoted to unconditionally singing its praises . 
r: deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
r: there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 
r: at once somber and mysterious , comical and sad . it shows just how lonely a crowded city can be . 
r: a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
r: you get the feeling that the filmmakers did their homework and that they're here to represent a harsh reality . " 
r: one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
r: anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
r: nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it's not even a tv special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break . 
r: leave it to rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago . 
r: one of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself , namely , an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then . 
r: a middlebrow hybrid that should satisfy most fans of spy movies without blowing them away . 
r: let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
r: the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration . 
r: that old adage about women being unknowable gets an exhilarating new interpretation in morvern callar . 
r: icon-bashing has never been as amusing as it is in michael rubbo's documentary much ado about something . 
r: with its young cast and an appealing balance of uplifting attitude and irreverent humor , drumline has the potential to be a sleeper hit . 
r: weird , vulgar comedy that's definitely an acquired taste . 
r: those who aren't put off by the film's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them . 
r:  . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
r: the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . 
r: continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means . 
r: rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories . 
r: [davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
r: a time machine , a journey back to your childhood , when cares melted away in the dark theater , and films had the ability to mesmerize , astonish and entertain . 
r: one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever . 
r: frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women . and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 
r: '[sex and lucia]is so seductive and profound , it's as if we're witnessing a greek myth coil and flower . . . '
r: while the costumes hint at changes beneath the surface , it is abbass' performance , as she vacillates flawlessly between muted hausfrau and shining hoofer , that reveals the depths of her transformation . 
r: it's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script . 
r: a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty . 
r: 77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
r: the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy . 
r: so purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it's a fairly straightforward remake of hollywood comedies such as father of the bride . 
r: no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
r: a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich . 
r: witherspoon and her huge forehead really were pretty funny and this movie was much better than her last effort , " legally blonde . " 
r: the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 
r: while the plot follows a predictable connect-the-dots course . . . director john schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades . 
r: each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 
r: interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . 
r: a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight . 
r: i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
r: in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film . 
r: by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 
r: inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 
r: despite the inexperience of the director and his cast , there's rarely a false moment . 
r: suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
r: compassionately explores the seemingly irreconcilable situation between conservative christian parents and their estranged gay and lesbian children . 
r: slight , but colorful and forward-moving . . . wasabi has the cheeky verve and heart of a shaggy dog movie that is aiming to please its owner , nothing more , nothing less . 
r: it is psychedelic , hypnotic , exhilarating and horrifying , and sometimes all at once . 
r: you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes , and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment . 
r: bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he can't help throwing in a few of his own touches . 
r: the subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow . 
r: this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
r: circuit queens won't learn a thing , they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets . 
r: any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
r: it's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism . 
r: as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away' sinks . 
r: humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
r: this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get . 
r: beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments . 
r: reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way . 
r: a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs . 
r: it's all entertaining enough , but don't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper . 
r: let's face it , even vin's fake tats have more charisma than pierce brosnan . 
r: a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
r: superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen . 
r: this is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller . 
r: if you're able to go , relax and lower your expectations , you might be carried away by it . 
r: the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
r: characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
r: not a film to rival to live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted . 
r: the warm presence of zhao benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be . 
r: one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
r: die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 
r: in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . 
r: the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication . 
r: a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
r: the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be . 
r: an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent . 
r: the movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects . 
r: oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
r: the band's courage in the face of official repression is inspiring , especially for aging hippies ( this one included ) . 
r: you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time . 
r: it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . 
r: this is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the saturday matinee , and it still is . 
r: more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . . 
r: the film belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public
r: a pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro . 
r: the casting of von sydow . . . is itself intacto's luckiest stroke . 
r: does what a fine documentary does best : it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively . 
r: uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth . 
r: at its best , the good girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery . . . 
r: it's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire ! 
r: there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
r: ararat is among the director's best work , a rendering of the past that offers hope for the future . 
r: a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture . 
r: a terrifically deft picture about the thick line that separates movie glamour from the real world , and the thin line between common sense and paranoia . 
r: a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
r: doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
r: while not quite " shrek " or monsters , inc . " , it's not too bad . it's worth taking the kids to . 
r: splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity . 
r: too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash . 
r: yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack . . . and his chemistry with shimizu is very believable . 
r: imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story , ' with ali macgraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes . 
r: for devotees of french cinema , safe conduct is so rich with period minutiae it's like dying and going to celluloid heaven . 
r: nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one . 
r: the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
r: it trusts the story it sets out to tell . 
r: funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director george hickenlooper all takes place in pasadena , " a city where people still read . " 
r: it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
r: it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
r: kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor . 
r: only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . 
r: it's fun , but the code-talk will fly right over everyone's head
r: director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great . 
r: once the viewer accepts the huge leaps of faith required in the film's premise , it's a lot of fun to strap oneself in and enjoy this goofy ride . 
r: this indie drama resonantly demonstrates how a person's worth is weighed in a town where you're only as good as your last game . 
r: texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare . 
r: this is not an easy film . but it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one . 
r: nothing short of a respectful testament to the ingenious creative drive of the outsider . 
r: the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
r: the santa clause 2 " goes down as easy as an eggnog on christmas eve . 
r: a mind-bender in the best sense of the word : the spell it casts follows you all the way home . 
r: the whole of sunshine state is less than the sum of its parts , but the parts are often lovely , and always true . 
r: the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task . 
r: graas s interaes entre seus personagens , o filme torna-se no apenas uma histria divertida sobre uma curiosa perseguio , mas tambm um belo estudo de personagens . 
r: a classic romance always involves a certain formula : boy meets girl , boy loses girl , boy gets girl . beijing bicycle is a romance , except the love interest is a bicycle and not a girl . 
r: waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . 
r: ana is a vivid , vibrant individual and the movie's focus upon her makes it successful and accessible . 
r: sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
r: henry bean's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers , but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect
r: like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls . 
r: in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
r: a compelling motion picture that illustrates an american tragedy . 
r: yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
r: [t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen . 
r: a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
r: a chick flick of the first order , disguised by just enough historical detail to elevate the proceedings somewhat . 
r: a film that perfectly distills the relationship between pop music and teens searching for identity . 
r: it understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking . 
r: a raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted korean american stand-up's i'm the one that i want . 
r: one of the best films i have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense . 
r: as lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that george lucas has long forgotten . 
r: a fine , rousing , g-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats . 
r: an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to . 
r: manages to be wholesome and subversive at the same time . 
r: without resorting to camp or parody , haynes ( like sirk , but differently ) has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange . 
r: granted , much of the marlovian argument is patently ridiculous ( was ben johnson really part of a massive cover-up ? ) but it's good fun . 
r: whatever eyre's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place . 
r: together writer-director danny verete's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt . 
r: there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
r: trademark american triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent french drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son . 
r: like a veteran head cutter , barbershop is tuned in to its community . 
r: schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
r: taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! ) , the sum of all fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller . 
r: strong stuff , minus the upbeat sentimentality of last year's oscar-winner . in that respect , it may be an even more important film . 
r: this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable . 
r: eul-boon kim's soulful portrayal of the illiterate , deaf-mute grandmother illuminates the dignity of her demeanor and the sad resignation in her eyes . 
r: some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen . 
r: it's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this " two weddings and a funeral " fun . 
r: chabrol ratchets up such a level of suspense -- and huppert gives such a mesmerizingly deadpan performance -- that merci pour le chocolat turns out to be as irresistible as a piece of dark chocolate . 
r: don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
r: 'the chteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
r: no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population . 
r: essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . 
r: i was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither . 
r: clint eastwood's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb& j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises  but still quite tasty and inviting all the same . 
r: the film's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen . 
r:  . . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else . 
r: i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
r: monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds . 
r: [griffith] adds another intriguing character to her formidable body of work . 
r: the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm . 
r: you'd think by now america would have had enough of plucky british eccentrics with hearts of gold . yet the act is still charming here . 
r: evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes . 
r: [it] has the feel of a summer popcorn movie . nothing too deep or substantial . explosions , jokes , and sexual innuendoes abound . 
r:  " catch me " feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark . 
r: may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow . 
r:  . . . there's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages . 
r: the french are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the americans , who have a passion for musketeers , only to spoof them . 
r: in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie . 
r: soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . 
r: the entertaining new film version of robert ludlum's 1980 spy thriller , the bourne identity , adds a crisp , tangy autumnal feel to the hot dog days of summer moviegoing . 
r: the very definition of the 'small' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher . 
r: this chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare . 
r: i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . cinematic poetry showcases the city's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything . 
r: one of the most successful , provocative and intensely contemporary of israeli films , so much so that to watch it is to feel the country having a passionate argument with itself . 
r: it downplays the initial assault , referring to it only in fragmented flashbacks , while offering a cogent critique of ongoing attitudes about rape and its victims , particularly in japan . 
r: full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , time out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life . 
r: in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie . 
r: it is fascinating to see how much work and preparation goes into stand-up comedy . 
r: you wouldn't call the good girl a date movie ( an anti-date movie is more like it ) , but when it's good , it's good and horrid . 
r: a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot . 
r: has just enough charm ( not to mention a sense of its own ridiculousness ) to stay afloat . 
r: all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
r: one of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved . 
r: the story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it's as if it all happened only yesterday . 
r: despite its flaws . . . belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn . 
r: celebrates family in a way that's deeply felt by the director and screenwriter/subject and no doubt will be shared by viewers of any ethnicity . 
r: the determination of pinochet's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director patricio guzman's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop . 
r: what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
r: portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama . 
r: the draw [for " big bad love " ] is a solid performance by arliss howard . 
r: everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
r: underachieves only in not taking the shakespeare parallels quite far enough . 
r: an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
r: unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit . 
r: an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
r: the sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack . 
r: the trinity assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and george ratliff's documentary , hell house , reflects their earnestness  which makes for a terrifying film . 
r: a clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film . . . 
r: a bonanza of wacky sight gags , outlandish color schemes , and corny visual puns that can be appreciated equally as an abstract frank tashlin comedy and as a playful recapitulation of the artist's career . 
r: throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh . 
r: i like it . no , i hate it . no , i love it . . . hell , i dunno . 
r: the director sees the strengths of alagna and gheorghiu and plays them for every cinematic moment . 
r: in this refreshingly shameless celebration of money and expensive stuff , director kevin bray grabs every retro action-film clich . 
r: still rapturous after all these years , cinema paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love . 
r: has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
r: highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager . 
r: a minor film with major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera . . . 
r: its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 
r: that we are not the target and still got ninety percent of it is a compliment to director charles stone iii and screenwriters matthew cirulnick and thulani davis who whipped the original story into coherent shape . 
r: i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
r: exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza . 
r: a very bizarre blend of reservoir dogs , fight club , unbreakable and croupier . 
r: a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire . 
r: peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
r: this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format . 
r: it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental . 
r: every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
r: a sweet film about two gentle souls - there is a genuine caring between them that feels like watching old friends . 
r: definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . 
r: this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc's , despite a few whopping shootouts . 
r: while dutifully pulling on heartstrings , directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix . 
r: the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
r: 'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
r: every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . 
r: while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey . 
r: a violent initiation rite for the audience , as much as it is for angelique , the [opening] dance guarantees karmen's enthronement among the cinema's memorable women . 
r: utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film . 
r: wise , cruelly observant of human nature and hysterically funny . 
r: a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags . 
r: a savage john waters-like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over . 
r: because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before . 
r: if the first men in black was money , the second is small change . but it still jingles in the pocket . it's fun lite . 
r: a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
r: las horas es una de las obras que con mayor apasionamiento reflexiona acerca del hecho de vivir . . . 
r: a fascinating literary mystery story with multiple strands about the controversy of who really wrote shakespeare's plays . 
r: it does what good films do best ; that is to provoke us , push our buttons , make us think and maybe even entertain us in the process . 
r: inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening . 
r: [siegal] proves that you don't have to be a just out of film school gen-x'er to make a resonant and entertaining movie about young adults . 
r: the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . 
r: this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least . 
r: will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly . 
r: drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
r: parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde's still-contemporary play . 
r: though shiri's eruptions of violence , mayhem and gunplay are every bit as kinetic and dazzling as anything generated in hong kong or hollywood , the film's primary focus is always on its characters . 
r: there's something about a marching band that gets me where i live . 
r: a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
r: filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home . 
r: a fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side of play . 
r: watching les destines , whose pace may not be for everyone , is to be virtually part of the creative process . 
r: thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun . 
r: ya-yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film . 
r:  . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
r: overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
r: the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
r: it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
r: a touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by michel piccoli . 
r: staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
r: one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year . 
r: a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . 
r: director roger michell mounts this thriller as an action-packed , sometimes tongue-in-cheek celebrity death match . 
r: about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
r: suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . 
r: the film's plot may be shallow , but you've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots . 
r: ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
r: resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year . 
r: not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare . 
r: the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
r: the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
r: a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men . 
r: as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet's airless cinematic shell games . 
r: ms . bennett is worth watching , and her story is weirdly detailed enough to prove once more that truth is too strange for good fiction . 
r: this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
r: the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson's magnolia and david lynch's mulholland dr . 
r: there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit . 
r: steve irwin's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume . 
r: i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
r: with a " spy kids " sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a " snl " has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
r: turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
r: god bless crudup and his aversion to taking the easy hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness . 
r: as any creature-feature fan knows , when you cross toxic chemicals with a bunch of exotic creatures , you get a lot of running around , screaming and death . on that score , the film certainly doesn't disappoint . 
r: the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap . 
r: the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . 
r: not only does this musical documentary showcase a band that's at the top of its form . . . it also serves as indictment of the ridiculously shallow , pre-fab music industry in general . 
r: once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
r: gran historia sobre el amor , la familia , la lealtad y la traicin que seguramente se convertir en un nuevo clsico del gnero . 
r: the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
r: a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
r: a memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill . 
r: the film's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard . . . 
r: harsh , effective documentary on life in the israeli-occupied palestinian territories . 
r: by turns gripping , amusing , tender and heart-wrenching , laissez-passer has all the earmarks of french cinema at its best . 
r: while it doesn't expose any new truths about the problems posed by reaching middle age , it reflects wisely on the truths that already exist . 
r: the movie's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries . 
r: the film creates an effective sense of time and place , though sheridan is not above hitting us over the head with obvious stylistic contrivances . 
r: a simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm . 
r: nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
r: nair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life . 
r: [while the last metro] was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history . 
r: a delightful fable about the enduring value of literature . 
r: it makes me feel weird / thinking about all the bad things in the world / like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies that die / and movies starring pop queens
r: 'de niro . . . is a veritable source of sincere passion that this hollywood contrivance orbits around . '
r: how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
r: the movie is never less than watchable and consistently entertaining , but the need to push gags too far keeps tripping it up . 
r: bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
r: the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom . 
r: as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing . 
r: like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive . 
r: the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 
r: in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995's forget paris . but even then , i'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes . 
r: try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment . 
r: sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
r: majidi's direction has never been smoother or more confident . 
r: the screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a " dungeons and dragons " fantasy with modern military weaponry . . . 
r: gay or straight , kissing jessica stein is one of the greatest date movies in years . 
r: perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions . 
r: for all its random chaos , divine secrets works because of the power of its convictions -- and its cast . 
r: the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year . 
r: watching spirited away is like watching an eastern imagination explode . 
r: harper and serkis are terrific , while caine carries the film with the authority of a man who has been here before . 
r: as immaculate as stuart little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous . 
r: director and co-writer hilary birmingham's maiden feature is a strong , polished , professional indie effort that bodes well for bigger success . 
r: laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
r:  it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 
r: a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity . 
r: theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical . 
r: the directing and story are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor's doorstep . but the actors make this worth a peek . 
r: ratliff deserves high marks for his restraint and willingness not to try and shape or mold our opinion regarding what is being shown . 
r: you'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous [than leon] . 
r: the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 
r: it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
r: kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . ( kirshner wins , but it's close . ) 
r: secretary manages a neat trick , bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie . 
r: it's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids . 
r: a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
r: shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic . 
r:  . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . 
r: this in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come . 
r: desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
r: plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story . 
r: legendary irish writer brendan behan's memoir , borstal boy , has been given a loving screen transferral . 
r: the amazing film work is so convincing that by movies' end you'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others . 
r: ' . . . both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat . '
r: there are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it's going to be a trip . igby goes down is one of those movies . 
r: it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
r: the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes . 
r: as a tearjerker this works pretty well , though long before it gets to work on your tear ducts , it starts to eat away at your nerves . 
r: rewarding for its brash originality and daring in etching a portrait of a man who refuses to take life's disappointments lying down . 
r: if the film had been in less-capable hands , the subject matter could have easily lent itself to eye-rolling ridicule , but huppert and haneke manage to keep the credibility intact , at least up to a point . 
r: the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low . 
r: generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it's not without style . 
r: an overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort . 
r: no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
r: as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . 
r: it's an exhilarating blast that makes good use of the large-format screen . 
r: even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
r: ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
r: compared to sorority boys . . . this is high comedic art . 
r: merely as a technical , logistical feat , russian ark marks a cinematic milestone . 
r: it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart
r: a major achievement and something to get excited about . 
r:  " 13 conversations " holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point . 
r: it's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more . 
r: the film is complex , intricate , interesting and almost hypnotizing , till charlie gets stuck ( the screenplay he's writing is the one you're watching ) . glad he had the gonads to do what he did then , but it subtracts from the overall entertainment value . 
r: paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks . 
r: a first-class , thoroughly involving b movie that effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film . 
r: b-type dialogue -- dirty jokes , overly emphatic declarations and other ripe lines -- make the movie camp fun . 
r: despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity . 
r: it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
r: best to just pick up a blade of grass and chew on it while absorbing the scenic imagery and natural acting of a strong cast . 
r:  . . . a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job . . . 
r: run , don't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen . 
r: s1m0ne's satire is not subtle , but it is effective . it's a quirky , off-beat project . . . . 
r: like brosnan's performance , evelyn comes from the heart . 
r: a brutal and funny work . nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully . 
r: while there are times when the film's reach exceeds its grasp , the production works more often than it doesn't . 
r: a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect . 
r: even though many of these guys are less than adorable ( their lamentations are pretty much self-centered ) , there's something vital about the movie . 
r: this film is difficult to watch for the inhumanity it depicts , but important to see for its factual elements and the reminder of both the difficulty and importance of maintaining one's humanity . 
r: the mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a t . 
r: despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed . the jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center . 
r: a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
r: the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
r: the film is darkly atmospheric , with herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath hearst's forced avuncular chortles . 
r: a different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know . 
r: it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue . 
r: walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
r: chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of jeffrey dahmer , serial killer . 
r: sincere energy gives this soul-searcher something magic to find - if even along the beaten path . 
r: the film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol . 
r: purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
r: about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream . 
r: the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays . 
r: a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 
r: the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . 
r: a provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love . 
r: a visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects . 
r: on the heels of the ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness . 
r: none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens . 
r: jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . 
r: one of the more intelligent children's movies to hit theaters this year . 
r: if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins . 
r: it's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast . 
r: the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable navet and arbitrary flashbacks . 
r: written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter . 
r: the film's most improbable feat ? it didn't go straight to video . 
r: yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
r: jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging . 
r: it's halloween season , and while ghost ship can't hold a candle to the ring for true primal scares , it'll probably stay respectably afloat until at least most of the candy is gone . 
r: the film's saving grace is the brilliant execution of its march numbers . 
r: ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
r: less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
r: the fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that broomfield's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer . 
r: it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
r: if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . 
r: burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
r: pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler .
