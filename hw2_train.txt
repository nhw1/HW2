p: as fran's requests become more peculiar , chep is thrown into increasingly bizarre situations . 
r: smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem . 
r: color , musical bounce and warm seas lapping on island shores . and just enough science to send you home thinking . 
r: it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another . 
r: a light-hearted french film about the spiritual quest of a fashion model seeking peace of mind while in a love affair with a veterinarian who is a non-practicing jew . 
r: my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy . in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more . 
r: works both as an engaging drama and an incisive look at the difficulties facing native americans . 
r: even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
r: when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart . 
r: the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
r: the script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material . 
r: the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
r: directed by david twohy with the same great eye for eerie understatement that he brought to pitch black . 
r: it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 
r: provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . after seeing 'analyze that , ' i feel better already . 
r: worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees . 
r: watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 
r: despite these annoyances , the capable clayburgh and tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age . 
r: it's a good thing that woolly mammoths are extinct , because this movie will have every kid in the schoolyard wishing for their very own . 
r: preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
r: 4ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly . 
r: si el siglo xxi necesita de h鲯es , el hombre ara񡠰arece haber llegado para quedarse . 
r: it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins . 
r: it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
r: writer/director walter hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable . 
r: hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script . 
r: extremely well cast , especially in the large number of supporting roles . 
r: a chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933 . 
r: a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation . 
r: impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . 
r: though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting . 
r: if you can keep your eyes open amid all the blood and gore , you'll see del toro has brought unexpected gravity to blade ii . 
r: there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
r: a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
r: it helps that lil bow wow . . . tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid . 
r: a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 . 
r: eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
r: nair doesn't use [monsoon wedding] to lament the loss of culture . instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions . 
r: stuffed to the brim with ideas , american instigator michael moore's film is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition . 
r:  . . . a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original . 
r: fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . 
r: starts slowly , but adrien brody  in the title role  helps make the film's conclusion powerful and satisfying . 
r: a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market . 
r: you really have to salute writer-director haneke ( he adapted elfriede jelinek's novel ) for making a film that isn't nearly as graphic but much more powerful , brutally shocking and difficult to watch . 
r: barry convinces us he's a dangerous , secretly unhinged guy who could easily have killed a president because it made him feel powerful . 
r: a distant , even sterile , yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan's heroes star bob crane . 
r: there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
r: director dan verete uses his camera as the metaphoric needle , and his cast in each segment as his thread , to form a sweeping tapestry of mis-explanation and contention . 
r: waydowntown just like most large cities , isn't somewhere you'll want to spend the rest of your life , but it sure is a fun place to visit for a while . 
r: the acting in pauline and paulette is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is debrauwer's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons . 
r: the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
r: there's lots of cool stuff packed into espn's ultimate x . 
r: it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you're in need of a cube fix--this isn't worth sitting through . 
r: harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment . 
r: the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . 
r: it's the kind of film where the villain even gives an evil look for his passport photo . how can you resist that ? 
r: plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year . 
r: a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
r: just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
r: this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
r: with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this cinderella story doesn't have a single surprise up its sleeve . but it does somehow manage to get you under its spell . 
r: a charming trifle . . . a welcome return to jocular form . 
r: it's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller . 
r: without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
r: there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
r: little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
r: anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going . 
r: every defiantly over-the-top action scene -- from high-stakes car chases to fearsome drug busts -- seizes your adrenal gland and milks it like an epileptic farmer . 
r: kosminsky . . . puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting . 
r: a sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one's mother . 
r: if the story lacks bite , the performances are never less than affectionate . 
r: a deftly entertaining film , smartly played and smartly directed . 
r: ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
r: i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's . 
r: ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years . 
r: skip work to see it at the first opportunity . 
r: both the film and nachtwey's photos hammer home the grim reality of the world's gutters and battlefields , and will make you question what 'news' really is . 
r: so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . 
r: shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes . 
r: that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . . 
r: against all odds in heaven and hell , it creeped me out just fine . 
r: nicely combines the enigmatic features of 'memento' with the hallucinatory drug culture of 'requiem for a dream . '
r: it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come . 
r: japan's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date . 
r: the work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them . strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency . 
r: in the spirit of voltaire and moli貥 , on guard volleys great wit and deadly gestures in a milieu of lush apparel , landscapes , captivating music and 18th-century lacy sleeves . 
r: while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 
r: while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
r: ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
r: es divertida , visualmente espectacular y muy entretenida . simple y sencillamente te sorprenderᠮ 
r: not since japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa's ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur . 
r: the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch . 
r: the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 
r: the next big thing's not-so-big ( and not-so-hot ) directorial debut . 
r: the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
r: judging from the strength of this superbly enigmatic film , oliveira himself seems far from ready to go home . 
r: passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats . 
r: christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
r: aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 
r: if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
r: the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects . 
r: it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
r: when your subject is illusion versus reality , shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real ? 
r: confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 
r: sitting in the third row of the imax cinema at sydney's darling harbour , but i sometimes felt as though i was in the tiny two seater plane that carried the giant camera around australia , sweeping and gliding , banking and hovering over some of the most not
r: may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation . 
r: the result reverberates on the screen with a deadly force and fury more intense than anything mr . scorsese has yet achieved on the meanest and most beloved streets he could imagine or recall . 
r: it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience . 
r: the leaping story line , shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits . 
r: it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
r: for a rapsploitation film to target and frown upon the darker forces of its nature is certainly a good sign for the maturation of the genre . 
r: a movie that doesn't aim too high , but doesn't need to . 
r: the kind of movie that seduces you into becoming putty in its manipulative card-sharking hands and making you enjoy being taken in by its shameless contrivance . 
r: an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
r: the best part about " gangs " was daniel day-lewis . 
r: the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims . 
r: rarely has skin looked as beautiful , desirable , even delectable , as it does in trouble every day . 
r: the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
r: the plan to make enough into an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a souffl頧one wrong . 
r: the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt's , no matter if it's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale . 
r: raunchy though [cho's] material is , it embraces all comers , regardless of gender , sexuality , race or ethnicity . and it's never been sharper -- or funnier -- than it is here . 
r: fans of behan's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy . 
r: miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . 
r: this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
r:  . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
r: human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
r: anchored by friel and williams's exceptional performances , the film's power lies in its complexity . nothing is black and white . 
r: the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
r: like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 
r: it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing . 
r: what one is left with , even after the most awful acts are committed , is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream . 
r: a competent , unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
r: louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . 
r: an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living . 
r: we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
r: as it turns out , you can go home again . 
r: using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead . 
r: in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
r: instead of trying to bust some blondes , [diggs] should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad . 
r: the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man . 
r: even if the world doesn't see things the way [michael moore] does , his questions are worth asking .  and bowling for columbine benefits from his iconoclastic zeal . 
r: the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
r: scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario . 
r: about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
r: automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
r: part of the film's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz . 
r: a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage . 
r: one of the best cat-and-mouse movies to come along in a while , leo has great fun in the role . 
r: kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
r: who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
r: open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations . 
r: with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , the spy kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids . 
r: oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 
r: resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
r: the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 
r: a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after the death of a child . 
r: a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left . 
r: depending upon your reaction to this movie , you may never again be able to look at a red felt sharpie pen without disgust , a thrill , or the giggles . 
r: la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , rᰩdamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
r: watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 
r: a thoroughly unoriginal , but fast-paced and entertaining genre b-flick
r: a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
r:  . . . devastatingly direct to the heart of the matter , demonstrating that there is no easy walk toward peace in a region with such strong conflicting traditions
r: a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers . 
r: a heartfelt , understated and occasionally heavy-handed slice of heartland . 
r: mostly , [goldbacher] just lets her complicated characters be unruly , confusing and , through it all , human . 
r: let's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate . 
r: how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
r: treats a potentially explosive set-up with adult reflection and thoughtfulness . 
r: there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
r: most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
r: i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
r: [majidi] makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day . 
r: not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream american audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit . 
r: but this is lohman's film . her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks . 
r: this tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , nicholas meyer's star trek vi : the undiscovered country . 
r: the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
r: broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
r: neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made , showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway . 
r: it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
r: any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
r: at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience . 
r: niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in hollywood , only god speaks to the press
r: it treats us to beautiful insights and tragic struggles that swell the heart and make us feel genuine empathy for two people embracing the truth amidst a pack of lies . 
r: completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
r: not a stereotype is omitted nor a clich頬eft unsaid . 
r: this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . 
r: the overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries . 
r: mr . jacobi's recitation is illustrated with a rush of sensuous nature imagery , beautifully photographed by mr . cox and hans sonneveld and underscored with a lush soundtrack by paul grabowsky . 
r: the acting is uniformly excellent , with kyra sedgwick and fairuza balk in particular deserving to be singled out for praise . 
r: who needs mind-bending drugs when they can see this , the final part of the 'qatsi' trilogy , directed by godfrey reggio , with music by philip glass ? 
r: 'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
r: a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
r: it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 
r: reminiscent of david mamet's elaborate screen bluffs -- only livelier , more playful . 
r: the cast , collectively a successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist , shows deft comic timing . 
r: if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . 
r: provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust . 
r: stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , 'tis . 
r: the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 
r: minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report . 
r: [reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion . 
r: inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . 
r: the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
r: the most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from portugal . 
r: one hour photo offers a very interesting snapshot of some decidedly modern pathologies -- suburban alienation and the illusions generated by the advent of the photographic image . 
r: it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff . 
r: it is best appreciated as an immersion in a three-dimensional toyland outfitted with enough whimsical gadgetry to fill a thousand playrooms . 
r: children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted . 
r: the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
r: nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
r: the film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it's propelled by the acting . 
r: focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device . 
r: a chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody . 
r: the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere . 
r: for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
r: a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
r: the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
r: this slight slice of l . a . life is distinguished by two fine , subtle performances . 
r: for all the wit and hoopla , festival in cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships . 
r: 'a fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '
r: making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror . 
r: the film isn't especially dynamic , but it brims with insightful , poignant memories from survivors . 
r: there's no denying how nice it is to see veteran actors bob hoskins , michael caine and helen mirren interacting with each other on screen . 
r: vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
r: between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap . 
r: great fun both for sports aficionados and for ordinary louts whose idea of exercise is climbing the steps of a stadium-seat megaplex . 
r: a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
r: this is , not to put too fine a point on it , a swashbuckler , a costume drama . if you love that old story form , you will be in old-fogy heaven , as it is nearly a perfect example of a genre that died out years ago . 
r: like to think of the film as local hero for kids , as the boy has to adapt from his urban kid lifestyle to the slow , simple ways of generations before . will he do it ? will it work out ? can love overcome ? 
r: bisset still commands the screen as the graceful and outspoken frances . 
r: for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded . 
r: tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world's great visual stylists , and in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances . 
r: lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 
r: the story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy . 
r: as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
r: i don't even care that there's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff . it's still terrible ! 
r: in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation . 
r: the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
r: city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . 
r: there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time . 
r: the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 
r: apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
r: the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 
r: stage director sam mendes showcases tom hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge . 
r: the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course . 
r: though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . 
r: being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
r: [i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
r: deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises
r: unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . 
r: it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
r: the actors are all charged up by their roles , and it rubs off on us : you walk out with a caffeine- and-doughnut high . 
r: naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 
r: it may . . . work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns . 
r: it's mildly amusing , but i certainly can't recommend it . 
r: the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
r: much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , haneke has a different objective in mind--namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation . 
r: nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay . 
r: juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
r: the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction . 
r: the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
r: just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
r: while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
r: seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work . 
r: it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . 
r: aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it . 
r: a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other . it's a feature-length adaptation of one of those " can this marriage be saved ? " columns from ladies home journal . . . 
r: the spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist . 
r: a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats . 
r: speaking in terms of spectacle , craft , romance and humor , it's the movie to beat this summer . 
r: imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made . 
r: huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she'll crack . 
r: too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century . 
r: there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch . 
r: jonathan parker's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films . 
r: light the candles , bring out the cake and don't fret about the calories because there's precious little substance in birthday girl -- it's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat . 
r: it's like a " big chill " reunion of the baader-meinhof gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists . 
r: it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 
r: the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
r: a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work . 
r: typifies the pros and cons of the films that india churns out . 
r: the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card . 
r: pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical . 
r: attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
r: those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one . 
r: secretary " is owned by its costars , spader and gyllenhaal . maggie g . makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen . 
r: the message becomes the savior for " the country bears , " an equal parts silly and sweet tale that wears its great big ol' heart on its grizzly-sized sleeve . 
r: an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
r: the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage . 
r: impossible as it may sound , this film's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition . 
r: this is one of jaglom's most accessible and genuinely enjoyable films . 
r: the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . 
r: a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics . 
r: why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
r: if much of me without you strikes a familiar chord , it also intelligently captures the difficulties that can disrupt even a close friendship . 
r: national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
r: i'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening , or the part where something's happening , but it's stupid . 
r: the huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent . 
r: as it stands , there's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more . 
r: a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race . 
r: a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 
r: the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally . 
r: there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television . 
r: the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 
r: it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
r: when the fire burns out , we've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that's where the film ultimately fails . 
r: few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands . 
r: blade ii is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time . 
r: this film puts wang at the forefront of china's sixth generation of film makers . 
r: like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . 
r: there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
r: no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess . 
r: it's not a great monster movie . but if you've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn , there's guilty fun to be had here . chomp chomp ! 
r: an uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations . 
r: spider-man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units . 
r: what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map . 
r: although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
r: an average coming-of-age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son's discovery of his homosexuality . 
r: 'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . '
r: the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power . 
r: it's an engrossing and thought-provoking examination of the overriding will to power and the morality of its application . 
r: a subtle , humorous , illuminating study of politics , power and social mobility . 
r: we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer . 
r: half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder . . . would be more at home on a daytime television serial . 
r: narrative may be looser than baby teeth , but amy's orgasm is such a verbosely in-depth exploration of female sensuality and identity . 
r: fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
r: benefits from a strong performance from zhao , but it's dong jie's face you remember at the end . 
r: as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame . 
r: the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
r: if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
r: dreamworks is to be commended for attempting to develop a form that , with the inauguration of the oscar for best animated feature , can only benefit from such tinkering . 
r: the minor figures surrounding [bobby] . . . form a gritty urban mosaic . 
r: it's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered . 
r: if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and clich頮 
r: showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
r: a droll , bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and small-town pretension in the lone star state . 
r: [the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 
r: da primeira seqꮣia de luta ࠰iada que encerra a hist󲩡 , o espectador jamais desgruda os olhos da tela , saindo do cinema com a sensa磯 de que gastou bem seu dinheiro . 
r: [smith] simply celebrates the universal desire to fashion our homes for our needs and desires . 
r: the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
r: there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
r: a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a direct-to-video' release . 
r: a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
r: largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
r: as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
r: the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers . 
r: performances are potent , and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving . 
r: peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery
r: twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . 
r: it's simply delightful to watch an actor like michel serrault do his stuff . 
r: it's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between morgan and redgrave . 
r: for his first attempt at film noir , spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future . 
r: the process of figuring out the moment the movie re-imagines the battle of the bulge with a bare-chested guardsman and a pike is more than worth the price of admission . 
r: it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
r: this documentary by stacy peralta makes a convincing case on behalf of skateboarding , of all things , as a catalyst for this change , and for some delinquent youths in a derelict los angeles neighborhood as its agents . 
r: the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of . 
r: weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 
r: this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
r: by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest cannot be revived . 
r: directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
r: becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
r: it's a movie -- and an album -- you won't want to miss . 
r: a work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy . 
r: in their love for each other and their ability to move on , the women are , in a way , lovely and amazing . 
r: not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
r: directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
r: this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better . 
r: delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . as each of them searches for their place in the world , miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity . 
r: what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
r: diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
r: offers big , fat , dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in . ah , what the hell . 
r: the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
r: sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
r: the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
r: that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed . 
r: it's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once . 
r: like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
r: this version does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre . 
r: australia : land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place . 
r: tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star . 
r: a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
r: insomnia is involving . still , i thought it could have been more . 
r: that dogged good will of the parents and 'vain' jia's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums . 
r: the film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence . 
r: [n]o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness . 
r: never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive . 
r:  . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
r: the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms . ambrose . 
r:  . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
r:  . . . more evocative than many other anime features , with its echoes of classic science fiction and contemporary cyberpunk . 
r: there are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness . 
r: bollywood/hollywood is a happy , carefree trifle of a movie that is easy to savour because it is so undemanding yet so rewarding . 
r: it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . 
r: even if you've seen " stomp " ( the stage show ) , you still have to see this ! 
r: casting its gaze on painting masterworks and thousands of jewel-encrusted , elaborately costumed extras , russian ark is like nothing you've ever seen . 
r: brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate . 
r: time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
r: no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make . 
r: warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . i loved this film . 
r: weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell . 
r: has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 
r: more entertaining than much of the big-studio schlock out there . 
r: by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
r: i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
r: a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie . 
r: kidd deals with lust and egoism the way a surgeon is interested in a tumor . he exposes ugly attitudes but maintains compassion for his mean-spirited subject . 
r: despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams " bathroom break ! " 
r: in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
r:  . . . pray doesn't have a passion for the material . he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race . 
r: somehow ms . griffiths and mr . pryce bring off this wild welsh whimsy . 
r: it's everything you don't go to the movies for . 
r: first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people . 
r: ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
r: spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around . 
r: unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
r: chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
r: the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
r: [hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
r: it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
r: full of unforgiving irony and quiet realism , a song for martin stands as a powerful and moving achievement . 
r: even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown . 
r: while cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem . 
r:  " maid in manhattan " is a charmer , a pc " pretty woman " that ditches the odious prostitution theme for class commentary
r: mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
r: a generic international version of a typical american horror film . 
r: even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad . 
r: every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn . 
r: the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we're touched by the film's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport . 
r: if you're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you're at the right film . 
r: it's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime . 
r: the longer one watches this determinedly ragged portrait of blue-collar teenage desperation . . . the more one gets absorbed in the utter unbridled nihilism of its 'characters . '
r: unfortunately this film will not satisfy if you are looking to discover the missing link , but if you are simply interested in humor and some 'interesting' footage , to say the least , you will not be disappointed . 
r:  . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
r: it's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed , but that's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie's strangeness . 
r: the movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music . there are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting . 
r: it's pithy without being saccharine ; it's funny without ever not taking itself seriously ; it's full of beautiful characters and great performances . 
r: unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
r: plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
r:  " punch-drunk love " is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . . 
r: normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
r: this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
r: morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start . 
r: the year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but take care of my cat emerges as the very best of them . 
r: the plot mechanics of read my lips eventually kind of spin into a fairly conventional thriller , but the wildly talented cassel and the unconventionally alluring devos give this movie a unique feel . 
r: pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
r: like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
r: what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness . 
r: the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
r: it's endearing to hear madame d . refer to her husband as 'jackie' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer . 
r: bravely explores the psychic damage inflicted on jean-luc by a withholding , then absent parent . 
r: isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
r: like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
r: it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood . 
r: the chaotic lead characters are not the sorts one will usually see in a disney film and that makes for a certain amount of unpredictability before it all returns to business as usual . 
r: the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones . 
r: jackass : the movie is a disgusting , repulsive , grotesque spectacle , but it's also hilarious and provocative . god help me , thumbs up . 
r: a lyrical , bittersweet film about what could be termed a by-product of battle . 
r: combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why didn't hollywood think of this sooner ? 
r: stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
r: you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet . 
r: you watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises . 
r: an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see . 
r: you'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it . 
r: stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
r: a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother/daughter relationship . 
r: so saccharine , i'm not sure i'd be able to take it under normal conditions . 
r: worth catching for griffiths' warm and winning central performance . 
r: waiting for godard can be fruitful : 'in praise of love' is the director's epitaph for himself . 
r: with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . 
r: hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u . s . -- a major director is emerging in world cinema . 
r: this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage . 
r: some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent . 
r: behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art . 
r: the story is timeless , but when adapted to the modern age , it makes for a wrenching film -- never preachy or sentimental , and refreshingly non-judgmental about the fundamental and contradictory issues it raises . 
r: a stormy french adolescent drama about friendship , family , and sexual politics . 
r: satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity . 
r: while the topic has grown heavier here , [moretti's] touch has not , and that disparity is precisely what gives the film its sustained poignancy . 
r: this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
r: deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
r: all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
r: the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 
r: if the movie is finally stuck halfway been cinema and prose , miller proves that it's not an unfertile place to linger . 
r: what doesn't this film have that an impressionable kid couldn't stand to hear ? 
r: this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
r: really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 
r: the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back . 
r: as janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm . 
r:  " 13 conversations about one thing " is an intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling . 
r: as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
r: although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey
r: as violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you've ever seen . 
r: aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
r: doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere . 
r: heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple's moral ascension . 
r: tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to liyan's backyard . 
r: even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , east-vs . -west coast rap wars , this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate . 
r: the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth . 
r: food for love endeavors and largely succeeds in lending equal weight to the emotional turmoil of its older and younger characters . 
r: it's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia . 
r: so beautifully acted and directed , it's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses . 
r: old people will love this movie , and i mean that in the nicest possible way : last orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship . 
r: one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
r: for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
r: a nicely constructed film with an unusual , though not unheard-of theme for chinese cinema . 
r: witty , charming , ultimately empathetic portrait of a once-upon-a-time industry titan . 
r: just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite . 
r: i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year . 
r: there's an uneasy balance between the comedy and the drama that doesn't really fire on all levels , but it works on a few of them . 
r: methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , secret ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it's so successful at lodging itself in the brain . 
r: the film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed . 
r: lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
r: the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face . 
r: one of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old walt doodled steamboat willie . 
r: the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves . 
r: once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours . 
r: it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success . 
r: a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution . 
r: a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes . . . almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination . 
r: the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
r: the real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star , jean reno , who resembles sly stallone in a hot sake half-sleep . 
r: the movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it . 
r: depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
r:  with one exception , every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big , comforting jar of marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness . 
r: you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
r: even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . 
r: the symbols float like butterflies and the spinning styx sting like bees . i wanted more . 
r: excellent performances from jacqueline bisset and martha plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama . 
r: light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time . 
r: even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea . 
r: isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol's most intense psychological mysteries . 
r: it's a shame that pokemon 4ever's dialogue is so trite and flatly delivered because the tale itself presents serious ideas worthy of more poetic language . 
r: poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . 
r: always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
r:  " on guard ! " won't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world's best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time . 
r: it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future . 
r: it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering . 
r: in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel's closely watched trains and danis tanovic's no man's land . 
r: ice cube , as usual , is an appealing presence , but the rest of the cast shines as well . 
r: unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
r: it shows us a slice of life that's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable . 
r: dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation . it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . ah yes , and then there's the music . . . 
r: the warnings to resist temptation in this film . . . are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean . 
r: one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade . 
r: this isn't exactly profound cinema , but it's good-natured and sometimes quite funny . 
r: the ending doesn't work . . . but most of the movie works so well i'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong . 
r: what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
r: captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family . 
r: an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular . 
r: it's [ricci's] best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world's misery with blind good will . 
r: a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making . 
r: martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid . 
r: holofcener sees all of her characters as loving and amazing and she spreads the love to each . 
r: cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
r: reminds viewers of how beautiful and sexy a pregnant woman can be . 
r: the threat implied in the title pok魯n 4ever is terrifying  like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
r: it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture . 
r: it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
r: there are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . 
r: it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
r: this epic film , eschewing dialogue and conventional narrative logic , tells a gripping tale of biological drama through a highly improbable series of evocative images , superb acting and editing , and haunting music . 
r: a world in small , subtly acknowledging larger economic and cultural forces one moment , and in the next patiently observing the way a bowl of medicinal tea , seen turning in a microwave carousel , begins to describe its own slow epicycles . 
r: if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
r: meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
r: land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored . 
r: an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 
r: it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 
r: it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
r: truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before . 
r: why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ? 
r: the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
r: the characters search for meaning in capricious , even dangerous sexual urges . the irony is that the only selfless expression of love may be the failure to consummate it . 
r: this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one . 
r: by embracing the original series' tacky elements and inserting just enough self-mockery to avoid smugness , the movie manages to fulfill basic expectations . 
r: turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts
r: this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years . 
r: i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
r: a mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in . 
r: with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
r: [allen] manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise . 
r: there's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments . and yet , it still works . 
r: in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
r: an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time . 
r:  . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror . 
r: it's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke . 
r: adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
r: nine queens is exactly the sort of film hollywood is always re-making and utterly ruining in the process . see it in this incarnation . 
r: so young , so smart , such talent , such a wise * * * . 
r: the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound . the hours is what movies are supposed to be . . . 
r: samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
r: it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
r: the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
r: audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
r: one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once . 
r: take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema . 
r:  . . . manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal . 
r: quirky and understated office comedy with crispin glover as the guy who would prefer not to work , but likes to hang around . 
r: such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
r: a sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern china . 
r: visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay . 
r: what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between . 
r: exposing the ways we fool ourselves is one hour photo's real strength . 
r: the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness . 
r: an entertaining romp that stays true to the material's television roots , this film is a good starting point for viewers unfamiliar with the series . 
r: somewhat blurred , but kinnear's performance is razor sharp . 
r: by the standards of knucklehead swill , the hot chick is pretty damned funny . 
r: quick pace , no lulls , many silly bits and a soundtrack that knows how to back this kind of satirical comedy
r: 'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates . 
r: punch-drunk love mostly feints and jabs ; by anderson's standards it's strictly lightweight . but sandler delivers the kind of knockout performance that even his staunchest defenders probably didn't realize he had in him . 
r: were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about cal than does the movie or the character any good , freundlich's world traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising american movies of the year . 
r: one thing you have to give them credit for : the message of the movie is consistent with the messages espoused in the company's previous video work . 
r: bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability . 
r: evelyn may be a weightless picture , but it's hardly torture to sit through . 
r: bernal . . . gives an ambiguous performance ; he's a lightweight actor , but that's a positive quality when portraying a man on whom nothing leaves a permanent mark . 
r: it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
r: testud is the burning center of a clinically dispassionate film . 
r: aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better . 
r: a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
r: frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes . 
r: got a david lynch jones ? then you'd do well to check this one out because it's straight up twin peaks action . . . 
r: it's something of the ultimate scorsese film , with all the stomach-turning violence , colorful new york gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas . 
r: this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever . 
r: an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances
r: together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death . in the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema . 
r: a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor . 
r: this orange has some juice , but it's far from fresh-squeezed . 
r: harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness . 
r: an intricate tale of guilt , grief and dark serendipity . . . so deft it's hard not to gasp with delight as the plot's pieces slide into place and its machinery begins humming . 
r: jaglom . . . put[s] the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters
r: one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret . 
r: there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
r: this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 
r: bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
r: a macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters . 
r: by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . 
r: as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
r: renee zellweger is amazing and richard gere brings a life to the screen that he hasn't in several years . 
r: angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately . 
r: the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants . it's like watching a nightmare made flesh . 
r: nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
r: playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity . . . bisset is both convincing and radiant . 
r: 'divertida , enternecedora , universal y profundamente sincera , es una de las mejores comedias rom᮴icas en mucho tiempo . una verdadera delicia . '
r: an extremely funny , ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary china . 
r: it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year . 
r: for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
r: what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
r: witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy . 
r: avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book . 
r: even people clueless about skateboarding can enjoy dogtown and z-boys . 
r: the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 
r: if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 
r: this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit . 
r: after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here , it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen . 
r: likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes . 
r: the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
r: essentially , noyce just wants to tell a good story , which he does . 
r: that a high-profile movie with big-name actors could inspire such philosophical reflection is impressive . 
r: not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly . 
r: an indelible and ultimately moving vision of humanity buffeted by the elements and by international political tides . 
r: stay clear of reminding yourself that it's a " true story " and you're likely to have one helluva time at the movies . 
r: an ingenious and often harrowing look at damaged people and how families can offer either despair or consolation . 
r: it's impossible to duplicate the shock of the 11-year-old lambs , but the new film succeeds at creating nerve-tightening moments of suspense . 
r: collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness . 
r: there's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache . 
r: the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
r: if h . g . wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin's reworked version , what would he say ? 'it looks good , sonny , but you missed the point . '
r: it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
r: a much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe . 
r: there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
r: a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole . 
r: with rare birds , as with the shipping news before it , an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion . 
r: makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
r: a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
r: it's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep . 
r: for those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s , the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed . 
r: though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
r: chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : david jacobson's dahmer . 
r: sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb . 
r: such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
r: the filmmakers lack the nerve . . . to fully exploit the script's potential for sick humor . 
r: does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
r: with " ichi the killer " , takashi miike , japan's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than batman . . . 
r: even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good . 
r: nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
r: like the hugely successful first film , the sequel provides pleasant , engaging if largely disposable entertainment for the general audience . 
r: the moral is not too original , but the offbeat characters certainly are . 
r: van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers . 
r: one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
r: a very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be . 
r: there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture . 
r: never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful . 
r: one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou . 
r: it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . 
r: but even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns . . . this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity . 
r: a directorial tour de force by bernard rose , ivans xtc . is one of this year's very best pictures . 
r: a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 
r: features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
r: it recycles every clich頡bout gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
r: though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . 
r: director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
r: it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
r: it's the end of the world as metaphor for how we scuttle relationships , and it's a remarkably apt one . 
r: the charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film's problems . 
r: 84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare . it's also , clearly , great fun . 
r:  . . . the one thing this wild film has that other imax films don't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house . that's fun for kids of any age . 
r: an unpleasant though sometimes effective psychological thriller that is noteworthy for being the film in which actress sandra bullock has gotten her act back together . 
r: this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
r: overall , it's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : god is love . 
r: great trash , one of those mediocre movies that in its own crass way is more enjoyable than most things that get nominated for oscars . 
r: an off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world . 
r: limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly . 
r: two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 
r: 'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
r: this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
r: if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . 
r: martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more . 
r: evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children--and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good . 
r: it's a weepy , nail-biting story line that's all too familiar , although abbass portrays her character with strong conviction and carries the film gracefully . 
r: a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience . 
r: carefully crafted , notably in its deft dramatic structuring , and has become timely in a way its maker could never have anticipated . 
r: human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard . 
r: utilizing lots of complicated , well-choreographed steadicam shots , la salle directs with confidence -- this may yet be his true calling . 
r: its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
r: once she lets her love depraved leads meet , [denis'] story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
r: 300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness . 
r: the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
r: solid . isn't as groundbreaking as shiri , but has its moments . 
r:  . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise . 
r: the movie is the strangest experience : a matter-of-fact thing that swallows you whole . 
r: they're just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood . 
r: the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
r: a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . 
r: payne has created a beautiful canvas , and nicholson proves once again that he's the best brush in the business . 
r: the bourne identity shouldn't be half as entertaining as it is , but director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood . 
r: a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) . 
r: leave it to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama . 
r: un thriller manqu頱ui tombe sur les nerfs presque d賠la premi貥 image . 
r: national lampoon's van wilder was better than we expected ; a 'not a total waste of money' kind of dateflick for those just hitting pre-collegiate years . 
r: the importance of being earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from bartlett's familiar quotations
r: for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league . 
r: one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning . 
r: barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful . 
r: the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change . 
r: affectionately reminds us that , in any language , the huge stuff in life can usually be traced back to the little things . 
r: an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . 
r: deeply-rendered , distinctly three-dimensional performances . . . make " altar boys " very engaging even though the story is never quite compelling enough to draw you in on its own . 
r: a well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog . 
r: the performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye . 
r: a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking . 
r: it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 
r: ranks among the best films ever made about the acting profession . 
r: as a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , sex with strangers is a success . 
r: mr . deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy . 
r: boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp characterizations to be mildly amusing . 
r: it is von sydow who gives intacto its gravity , resonance , soul . 
r: a compelling allegory about the last days of germany's democratic weimar republic . 
r: it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
r: the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart . 
r: the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
r: to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
r: if you grew up on scooby -- you'll love this movie . matthew lillard is born to play shaggy ! 
r: a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls . 
r: the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
r:  . . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape . 
r: comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . 
r: at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated ( depending upon where you live ) , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 
r: in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . 
r: a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys . 
r: with a completely predictable plot , you'll swear that you've seen it all before , even if you've never come within a mile of the longest yard . 
r: there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners can't overcome , but it's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling . 
r: a superbly acted and funny/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate . 
r: desta vez , columbus capturou o pomo de ouro . 
r: if you're an extreme sports fan , this is probably a must own dvd . 
r: an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . 
r: not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
r:  " an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . " 
r: i certainly found its depiction of a family affected by grief far more believable and effective than the strident dish-breaking , breast-beating of in the bedroom . 
r: i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 
r: more intimate than spectacular , e . t . is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades . 
r: this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
r: too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization . 
r: it is intensely personal and yet -- unlike quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times . 
r: amold&oacute ; var is a master of emotional texture , peeling away layer upon layer of the feelings . . . until he reaches benigno's troubled psyche and marco's benevolent soul . 
r: so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
r: the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that's where this film should have remained . 
r: reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies . 
r: this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , scorsese's best in more than a decade . 
r: an intelligently made ( and beautifully edited ) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch . 
r: if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
r: the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
r: a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day . 
r: the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen . 
r: there's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable . 
r: smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise . 
r: going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
r: many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
r: dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
r: it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color . 
r: it may not be " last tango in paris " but . . . 
r: there's much tongue in cheek in the film and there's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all . 
r: care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 
r: the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie . 
r: a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine . 
r: a psychological thriller that doesn't really hold up if you think about it too much , but is nonetheless highly entertaining in a low-budget , david lynch-ian way . 
r: part of the long , noble tradition ( at least since the '90s ) of talky , ensemble-driven american indies . 
r: this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one . 
r: as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso , sia lacks visual flair . but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them . 
r: although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love . 
r: for those with the stomach and stamina for its heartbeat-quickening intensity and body-slamming action , rollerball delivers exactly what it promises : a people's hero you can really get behind . 
r: if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing . 
r: just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years . 
r: in this vivid , emotionally complex ensemble piece , korean writer-director jeong jae-eun portrays this extraordinary turning point in every woman's life . 
r: dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
r:  . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 
r: if you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite . 
r: slowly but surely devolves into a fascinating , cringe-inducing portrait of cultural solipsism , climaxing in an emotional meltdown that wouldn't look out of place in mid-period cassavetes . 
r: a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term . 
r: it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
r: scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
r: it's hard not to like a film that has sky divers jumping out of helicopters to catch flying dragons in a big net . 
r: none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
r: what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
r: this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
r: to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree . 
r: this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man . 
r: plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . 
r: it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
r: a touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community . 
r: its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
r: just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever . 
r: a little weak -- and it isn't that funny . 
r: as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
r: if the count of monte cristo doesn't transform caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago . 
r: so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
r: a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . 
r: a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe . 
r: quiet , sexual , disturbing , often beautifully melancholic . 
r: the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
r: the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
r: no way i can believe this load of junk . 
r: its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
r: what the director can&#8217 ; t do is make either of val kilmer&#8217 ; s two personas interesting or worth caring about . 
r: [grant's] bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle . 
r: renner's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing . 
r: all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
r: what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . 
r: the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one . 
r: the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . 
r: prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment . 
r: carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
r: this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 
r:  . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
r: riveting when it focuses on the challenges of crossing a generational divide . 
r: a fanciful drama about napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility . 
r: for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
r: the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
r: with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles . 
r: a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
r: viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess . 
r: jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness . 
r: has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion . 
r: a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis . 
r: it's their familial ups and downs that shift this small , stubbornly poignant documentary . . . from the realm of special-interest audiences to the more universal theater of family psychodynamics . 
r: watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
r: it's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . you don't want to call the cops . you want to call domino's . 
r: it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing . 
r: holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks . 
r: genuine movie magic . . . it transports you to a place somewhere between eavesdropping voyeur and silent referee . 
r: a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . 
r: it picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film . 
r: despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity . 
r: it has something of the aura of four weddings and a funeral about it , mixed in with a bit of bridget jones's diary , but the movie's just too different , too risky for huge popularity . 
r:  . . . the plot weaves us into a complex web . 
r: a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
r: i enjoyed " formula 51 " in a guilty kind of way
r: even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
r: the chⴥau would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . 
r: novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach . 
r: the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
r: could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals . 
r: a reminder that beyond all the hype and recent digital glitz , spielberg knows how to tell us about people . 
r: the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
r: if your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket . 
r: the off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery . 
r: as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
r: it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
r: 'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
r: best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere . 
r: with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in . 
r: like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
r: the sequel drops the adult aspects of the story in favor of talking reindeer and a life-size , plastic santa replacement ( also played by allen ) that is strongly reminiscent of that creepy family from the duracell commercials . 
r: an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . 
r: a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores . 
r: what emerges is not only an underdog v . simon bar sinister saga but a fascinating character study . 
r: mehta expertly fashions a fascinating hybrid that is sure to delight audiences with its good-natured and well-timed humor , and its unabashed refusal to take itself seriously . 
r: adaptation's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary . 
r: the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites . 
r: add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney's a good director . 
r: the crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us . 
r: swimming isn't a major film . nor does it try to be . but what , in the end , is a major film ? if it's one that accomplishes what it sets out to do , then we ought to correct ourselves . 
r: obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script . 
r: on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
r: embarrassed myself about laughing out loud multiple times , i found myself enjoying the movie much more than i ever enjoyed the tv show . . . and these pseudo-homo-erotic stunts . 
r: aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
r: part of the draw of dance is the impossibility to define its particular joy . tavernier's film conveys a large element of its appeal -- and more . 
r:  . . . manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun . 
r: despite its faults , this is a fascinating look at a subculture . 
r: less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . 
r: ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much . 
r: the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
r: an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
r: sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
r: mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
r: shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
r: huppert's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face . 
r: makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man's greatness . 
r: as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting . 
r: most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
r: so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
r: any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
r: a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty . 
r: professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 
r: a pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties . 
r: ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
r: i basically went in expecting garbage , but color me surprised when it actually turned out to be quite funny ! 
r: the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries . 
r: turning a great movie into a pretty good one is still a step in the wrong direction . . . and the ring will never be more than a pretty good movie . 
r: formula 51 is pretty much quentin tarantino meets guy ritchie , as directed by ronny yu . however , if you like that sort of thing , as i do , you just might have some fun with the chemical imbalance of formula 51 . 
r: at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary . 
r: the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
r: i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
r: the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
r: an engaging documentary about people who live in unusual homes . 
r: kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that . 
r: a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
r: sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
r: secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion . 
r: it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study . 
r: outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride . 
r: though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
r: everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting . 
r: those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters' foibles a timeless and unique perspective . 
r: swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
r: if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 
r: julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan . 
r: the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
r: not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 
r: viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
r: as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
r: there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
r: charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
r: it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . 
r: for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
r: unlike most anime , whose most ardent fans outside japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes , metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile . 
r: this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
r: trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all . 
r: thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
r: de oliveira seems not only to have read john berger's famous essay on looking , but also to have taken it as his personal instruction manual for filmmaking . 
r: a great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . 
r: what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ? 
r: the exposition does pay off , if you can stay awake that long . there's little gripping in the film until the second hour . 
r: lan yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece . it is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it . 
r: in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
r: a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 
r: philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach . 
r: sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ) , but still a very good time at the cinema . 
r: hoffman spends a good deal of screen time alone and without much dialogue , using only his considerable physical skill and screen presence to pull off the role . 
r: macbeth . mcdonald's . how far apart these poles of popular culture seemed until billy morrissette's sly mcshakespeare crime comedy . 
r: bielinsky's script is slick and fiendishly clever , with seemingly a twist a minute . 
r: sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
r: in the pianist , polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way . 
r: romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
r: comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire . 
r: the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
r: first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ? 
r: drumline is a movie that treats its characters and audience with respect ; it can't be accused of being a dumbed-down teen comedy . 
r: whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like . 
r: if you're willing to have fun with it , you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful . 
r: not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made . 
r: the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish . 
r: [a] wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 
r: cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film's saving graces . 
r: winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars . 
r: culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
r: it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable . 
r: i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
r: to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
r: adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 
r: transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the x into the games . 
r: unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . 
r: beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself . 
r: it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
r: it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back . 
r: the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . 
r: the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
r: there's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film . . . or the emotional integrity of the performances . 
r: with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast . 
r: despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
r: it's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack . 
r: alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick . 
r: a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
r: gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western . 
r: in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
r: woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
r: the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
r: in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level . 
r:  . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
r: beautifully acted , smart and funny . it steers clear of being a maudlin soap opera normally found on lifetime . 
r: in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . 
r: a bit of whimsically warped history elevated by the central performance of ian holm . 
r: it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he's been making for the last several years . 
r: a terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown . 
r: it's a celebration of self-confidence and a slap in the face of a society that cherises impossibly unnatural physical perfection . 
r: the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . 
r: instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life . 
r: an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss . 
r: a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal . 
r: the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
r: a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film . 
r: malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
r: one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
r: a profoundly moving document . . . the filmmakers' refusal to downplay the situation's intractability makes the glimmer of hope the film offers that much more powerful . 
r: the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
r: a sparkling cosmopolitan comedy that plays fast and loose with sacred cows of family values . 
r: there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
r: an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it isn't . 
r: [city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . 
r: not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions . 
r: if the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals , it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material . 
r: if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
r: it is a testament of quiet endurance , of common concern , of reconciled survival . 
r: it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
r: it's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good . 
r: a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle . 
r: i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending . 
r: definitely not the knee-slapper that i was told it would be , but enough hahas for me to grade as passable . 
r: oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition . 
r: for the most part , director anne-sophie birot's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama . 
r: the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
r: it's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom . 
r:  . . . a vast adventure that bristles with romance , action and heroism . 
r: it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 
r: one of the year's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces . 
r: it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
r: the trials of henry kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking  because you get it . 
r: an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
r: a merciless thriller , threateningly beautiful to look at and eerie to behold . 
r: certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
r: this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family . 
r: presents a most persuasive vision of hell on earth . 
r: no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
r: elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
r: hoffman's performance is authentic to the core of his being . 
r: i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes . 
r: a quirky comedy set in newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that's so prevalent on the rock . 
r: exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter . 
r: a dizzying digital video oddyssey through the snowy woods of upstate new york . 
r: more than the last time around , it has elements that might help divert those bigger people who find themselves unavoidably in attendance . 
r: the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down . 
r: a biopic about crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video . 
r: like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
r:  " the best disney movie since the lion king " 
r: the storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema . 
r: uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity . 
r: a mess when it comes to the characters and writing . . . but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory . 
r: i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness . 
r: although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . 
r: the quirky and recessive charms of co-stars martin donovan and mary-louise parker help overcome the problematic script . 
r: the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy . 
r: jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot . 
r: mature , graceful documentary on conservative christian parents with homosexual children . 
r: while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
r: i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
r: the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids . 
r: the journey to the secret's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough . 
r: the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 
r: mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness . 
r: it would be a mistake to write this movie off as yet another star is born-type biopic about the rise and fall of a latter&#8209 ; day celebrity . schrader is after something deeper here and even when he misses the mark , the film remains involving . 
r: one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time . 
r: jones has crafted a natty narrative that , enhanced by erin nordstrom's editing , is filled with payoffs . 
r: it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
r: there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
r: smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes . 
r: the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 
r: beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '
r: a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession  one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom . 
r: tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
r: russian ark moves beyond a simple technical exercise and into the realm of greatness . it's a masterpiece on every level . 
r: a coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clich鳠and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood . 
r: this humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that 'they don't make movies like they used to anymore . '
r: a documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it is scary . 
r: savvy director robert j . siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense . 
r: although olivier assayas' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation . . . its three-hour running time plays closer to two . 
r: whenever you think you've figured out late marriage , it throws you for a loop . 
r:  . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
r: without blowing the jokes we can say that , if you have found that your sense of humor fit well with christopher guest's screen outings , you'll find yourself in the flow with shearer as well . 
r: if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but wasn't , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor . 
r:  . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
r: has an impact that transcends politics and some dramatic overreaching by writer-director randall wallace . 
r: we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . 
r: it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style .
